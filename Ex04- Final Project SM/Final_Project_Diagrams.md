## Description of Project 
Pilots need to monitor and evaluate weather continously before heading out into a plane. My project is a weather monitoring and evaluation station for pilots. The system will contain a variety of sensors to measure temp, humidity, precipitation and air pressure. The system will take in the information and provide a recommendation for whether or not to "take to the sky". Information will be provided to a pilot through a 
## Components Needed (Need to use at least three peripherals) 
- Temperature Sensor - I2C

- Barometer Sensor - I2C 
- Anemometer? (wind speed) 
- Visibility Sensor? 
- Weight Sensor for Rainfall/ Releases rain -> ADC 
- BLE -> 
- Button -> GPIO
